## Introduction

Our project aimed to create a weather monitoring system using IoT and machine learning techniques to predict future weather patterns based on temperature and humidity data collected over time. The system was designed using Node MCU and DHT11 sensors for accurate data collection and transfer. We employed two prediction models - ARIMA and LSTM - for detailed analysis of the collected data. The comparison of these models showed that the deep learning-based LSTM model performed better than the standard ARIMA model. Weather monitoring is important in various industries like agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and smart agriculture can be achieved using machine learning techniques.

### LSTM Model

- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of neural network that excels in capturing long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data.
- In this project, we use LSTM to forecast future temperature values based on past observations.
- The LSTM model is trained on historical temperature data and then used to predict the temperature values for a given time period.

## Forecasting Analysis Using ARIMA

### ARIMA Model

- ARIMA, short for 'AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average,' is a class of models that explains a given time series based on its own past values.
- The key idea is that the current value of any time series data can be determined by its own past values.
- For ARIMA models to work, the necessary condition is to have stationary data.
